## Exploring Engineering Student Data - Batch wise Data Analysis

In the project focused on exploring engineering student data, I created a website for my college to facilitate batch-wise data analysis. The website is designed for teachers and provides various functionalities, including tabulating SGPA for four years of a batch, downloading data in CSV format, accessing edit options, viewing academic performance summaries, individual student performance, batch-wise performance, and distribution of marks.

To implement this project, I used Python along with the Streamlit framework for building the web application. For data visualization, I utilized libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create interactive and informative visualizations that help in analyzing the student data effectively.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for teachers to analyze and manage student data, aiding in better academic decision-making and performance evaluation.
